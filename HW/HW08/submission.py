# Problem 1: propositional logic
# Convert each of the following natural language sentences into a propositional
# logic formula.  See rainWet() in examples.py for a relevant example.

# Sentence: "If it's summer and we're in California, then it doesn't rain."
def formula1a():
    # Predicates to use:
    Summer = Atom('Summer')               # whether it's summer
    California = Atom('California')       # whether we're in California
    Rain = Atom('Rain')                   # whether it's raining
    # BEGIN_YOUR_CODE (our solution is 1 line of code, but don't worry if you deviate from this)
    raise Exception("Not implemented yet")
    # END_YOUR_CODE

# Sentence: "It's wet if and only if it is raining or the sprinklers are on."
def formula1b():
    # Predicates to use:
    Rain = Atom('Rain')              # whether it is raining
    Wet = Atom('Wet')                # whether it it wet
    Sprinklers = Atom('Sprinklers')  # whether the sprinklers are on
    # BEGIN_YOUR_CODE (our solution is 1 line of code, but don't worry if you deviate from this)
    raise Exception("Not implemented yet")
    # END_YOUR_CODE

# Sentence: "Either it's day or night (but not both)."
def formula1c():
    # Predicates to use:
    Day = Atom('Day')     # whether it's day
    Night = Atom('Night') # whether it's night
    # BEGIN_YOUR_CODE (our solution is 1 line of code, but don't worry if you deviate from this)
    raise Exception("Not implemented yet")
    # END_YOUR_CODE
